# PipedriveTOPowerBI
A simple and direct pipedrive connector for Microsoft PowerBI.

Uses the entity Deal of Pipedrive as an example, but it can evolve and quickly make a nice dashboard with lots of entities.

Just place the code on the "Advanced Editor".

The code was done with the M or Power Query Language.

Thank you for visiting.
